# Hang out app

This application is a messenger. It allows for easy group messaging. It uses sockets to display and update data in real time

## What I was learn

Mastered WebSockets for real-time data display: I now know how to use WebSockets for real-time two-way communication between the browser and the server. This allows you to create dynamic content that is constantly updated and improve the user experience.
Analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of sockets: Working with WebSockets, I not only learned how to use them, but also realized their strengths and weaknesses. Now I can reasonably choose the appropriate communication protocol for different web tasks.
